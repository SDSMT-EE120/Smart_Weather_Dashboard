# PART 1: Arduino Uno Version (in TinkerCAD)

## Software

Open TinkerCAD and create a project. 

## Components

- 1 x Arduino Uno 

- 1 x Temperature Sensor (TMP36)

- 1 x LED 

- 2 x 220 Ω resistor

- 1 x 16x2 LCD Display (NOT I2C)

- 1 x Potentiometer 

- 1 x Breadboard

## Building 

Using the componets above create the circuit below. To receive full credit your circuit should look identical to the design below.

## Functionality: 

- Reads temperature form TMP36

- Turns on LED if temp > 30°C

- Display temperature on external LCD 

## Code: 

As the point of this assignment is not to learn how to code in C.  I have provided the code for writing to and using the LCD display.  Before implementing your part, you should review this code and understand how it works.  

Your part is to create the logic of

1. When tempature is above 30°C turns LED on 

2. Displays the tempature on the display 

## Deliverables for Part 1
